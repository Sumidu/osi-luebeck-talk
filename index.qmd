## FAIR Data

- Findable – making research outputs discoverable by the wider academic community and the public,
- Accessible – using unique identifiers, metadata and a clear use of language and access protocols,
- Interoperable – applying standards to encode and exchange data and metadata and...
- Reusable – enabling the repurposing of research outputs to maximise their research potential.


## Reproducibility

Studies funded by the OSF found only 50% of findings replicate

#### Reasons

- Bad research design
- HARKing, p-hacking

#### Problems

- Lack of analysis code availability
- Lack of raw data availability
- Problems with reproduction efforts


## What is reproducibility? 

![](figures/rr.png){.absolute top=50 right=50 width="200" height="200"}

#### Computational reproducibility

- access to code and data 
- Others can reproduce your results.

#### Empirical reproducibility
- sufficient information to recreate experiments or copy the study

#### Replicability
- quality of an outcome and a study
- not discussed here



## Future of Scholarly Communication

Science communication has to adapt.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Science and peer-reviewed publications should be **publicly accessible**.
- **Multiple output formats** for different types of audiences

What are **tools** that support this outcome?

## New publication formats

![](figures/open_access_wheel.png)

## Education and Skills

Researchers must learn to apply open science principles [@skillseu].


- library and information skills
- open publication literacy skills
- data management and open data skills
- data science skills
- etc.

# Why do open science?

## Why do open science?

#### Value-based reasons 

- increases rigour, accountability, and reproducibility
- based on inclusion, fairness, equity, and sharing
- We get paid by the public, our results should be public



## Why do open science?

#### Benefits of open science

![](figures/citation_advantage.jpeg){.absolute top=250 right=-150 width="600" height="500"}

- Open research gets more attention [@piwowar2013data]
  - easier to cite
  - easier for others to work with
  - easier for collaborators

. . .

Easier **for you** to follow up.



# Making your research open is a lot of work

# How to do open science?





# Literate Programming 

Programming "mixed" with explanations (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, RMarkdown, Quarto). 

## Quarto 

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.
It allows creating dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.

. . .

This presentation was created in Quarto.

. . .

It is available live:

 - as a website: [https://osiluebeck23.netlify.app/](https://osiluebeck23.netlify.app/)
 - as source code: [https://github.com/Sumidu/osi-luebeck-talk](https://github.com/Sumidu/osi-luebeck-talk)


## How does it work?

Quarto files are markdownfiles that include executable code blocks.

Under the hood `Pandoc` renders the output files.
It uses a YAML header for additional rendering information.

## Single source, multiple output files

Quarto renders:

- Latex (Beamer, article)
- Epub
- Office Files (pptx, doc)
- HTML Websites
- Journal articles
- your own templates
- many more, see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html){preview-link="true"}


## Viewing Code

When you **render** a quarto document, an output file will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. 

You can embed code like this:

```r
# This is a simple addition
1 + 1
# This calculates a mean
mean(c(1, 2, 4, 5, 123))

```


## Running code

Obviously you can also execute the code inside of a quarto document.


```{r}
#| echo: true

# This is a simple addition
1 + 1
# This calculates a mean
mean(c(1, 2, 4, 5, 123))
```


## Interactive Visualizations

You can add interactivity using observable javascript. 

```{ojs}
data = FileAttachment("palmer-penguins.csv").csv({ typed: true })
```


```{ojs}
//| panel: sidebar
viewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(
  [32, 50], 
  {value: 35, step: 1, label: "Bill length (min):"}
)
viewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream"], 
  { value: ["Torgersen", "Biscoe"], 
    label: "Islands:"
  }
)
```

```{ojs}
filtered = data.filter(function(penguin) {
  return bill_length_min < penguin.bill_length_mm &&
         islands.includes(penguin.island);
})
```

```{ojs}
Plot.rectY(filtered, 
  Plot.binX(
    {y: "count"}, 
    {x: "body_mass_g", fill: "species", thresholds: 20}
  ))
  .plot({
    facet: {
      data: filtered,
      x: "sex",
      y: "species",
      marginRight: 80
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.frame(),
    ]
  }
)
```

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
